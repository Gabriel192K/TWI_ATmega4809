TWI library for TWI bus communication protocol used on ATmega4809 MCU

## Key features
- Compatible with `Arduino IDE` & `Microchip Studio IDE`
- ```begin()``` and ```end()``` functions to easily enable or disable the `TWI` bus
- Interrupt and a result-type machine state driven logic for both transmission and reception as `master`
- No support for `slave` yet

## Tested on
- `ATmega4809` @16MHz using and `Arduino IDE` with a 400kHz `TWI` bus frequency
